[ScreenBounce.com](https://screenbounce.com/) is a DVD screensaver website. It is completely useless, but maybe if you are lucky you can see the logo touch the corner of the website!

## Features
The website includes a settings panel that lets users customize the appearance of the website. The settings button is hidden until you move the mouse, letting you enjoy the black void and bouncing logos without distractions.

The settings panel contains cards representing each logo. Each card allows you to:
- Upload custom images to bounce around.
- Adjust the number of logos bouncing on screen.
- Use custom text for logos, including ASCII art.
- Change speed and size of the logos.

The website will also:
- Save all settings locally in your browser using IndexedDB, so your preferences are remembered for next time.
- Automatically detect and adjust to window size changes, keeping the bouncing logos responsive at all times.
